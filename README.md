# Face-Emotion-Recognition
Face Emotion Recognition
for Artificial Vision Proyect

## Proyect
This proyects train a convolutional neural network to recognize emotions either on a real time video using the camera or either analyzing photos.

## Usage
If you'd like to try it you will hace to create a model using the train.py, this will generate a model inside the models folder, you will give a route to this model inside the fed_video.py and you should be able to utilize it with your camera

### Dataset
The dataset used in this proyect is FER2013 a dataset utilize commonly for Facial Emotion Recognition
